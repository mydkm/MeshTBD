## Why?

Modern 3D processing software sucks, especially when it comes to its scripting capabiltiies. For now, we start with turning an ideal 3D model of a body part into a cast with a Voronoi pattern. <br>

## Project Structure

- 'MeshTBD/Drafts' - where we put the scripts that don't particularly work, but some of its parts may be eventually useful
- 'MeshTBD' - the scripts that are actively being altered, any relevant 3D models to running these scripts <br>

# Setup

## Getting Started

Note the naming conventions are as follows:
'tags+includedPackages_currentProgress'

TBD!
