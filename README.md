## Why?

Modern 3D processing software sucks, especially when it comes to its scripting capabiltiies. We aren't tackling a full app as of yet, we're starting with turning a 3D model of a body part into a cast with a Voronoi pattern. <br>

## Project Structure

Note that this project only works on Python 3.11.X.

- 'MeshTBD/Drafts' - where we put the scripts that don't particularly work, but some of its parts may be eventually useful
- 'MeshTBD/Meshes' - some of the intermediate meshes we've been playing around with during the project
- 'MeshTBD' - the scripts that are actively being altered, any relevant 3D models to running these scripts <br>

# Setup

## Getting Started

Note the naming conventions for the python scripts in this repository are as follows:
'tags_currentProgress.py' (Python scripts available in 'MeshTBD/Meshes' have the 'tags+includedPackages_currentProgress.py' naming conventions)

TBD!
